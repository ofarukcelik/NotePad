### Deadline

We'll be waiting for your solution within 4 days.

### Goal ###

Develop a simple note app that allows the user to save/edit/delete any kind of note and display them in a list.

### Functional Requirements ###

* Kotlin is preferred but not a must.
* Users must be able to create notes with input fields such as title, description, image url (input can be optional) and store it locally on their phones.
* Created note must contain a created date.
* There must be a way to display all saved notes in the list. An item on the list must contain the created date (dd/mm/yyyy), the image if url is available, title and max. 2 lines of description.
* There must be a way to edit/delete previously created notes. But edited notes must contain an (edited) tag somewhere while being displayed on the list.
* All data should be persisted locally.

### UI Suggestions ###

It doesn't need to be super pretty, but it shouldn't be broken as well. The design is mostly up to you as long as creating, listing and editing/deleting features are available to use.

Nice to have:
* Animations/Transitions
* At least one custom view

### Expectations ###

Consider this as a showcase of your skills.
Approach it as if you are going to make a pull request on our main/master branch.

We are expecting at least:
* Clear, defined architecture.
* Apply the Material Design Guidelines as much as possible.
* Meaningful tests (You do not need to have 100% coverage, but we will be looking for tests).
* Good and lint verified syntax.
* The code can be hosted in any git repository. We expect a clear history in the repo. We don't mind your choice of git strategy as long as it has a track of your progress.
* The repo must be private and should not contain any references to Getir in it.
* The code must compile.
* The code must be production ready. Unit tests are expected.
